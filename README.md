# Todo-list
# 1.User Authentication:
Create registration and login forms with fields for username and password.Implement validation for input fields.Use local storage to store user credentials securely.
# 2.Authentication State:
Use React state to manage the authentication state.Create a context or use a state management library like Redux to handle authentication state globally.Implement protected routes to control access to specific parts of the app based on the user's authentication status.
# 3.Task Management:
Design a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks.Ensure that tasks are associated with the logged-in user. Store tasks in local storage along with the user's identifier.
# 4.Logout:
Create a logout button that clears the user's authentication state and redirects them to the login page.
# 5.User Interface:
Focus on creating a clean and intuitive design for both the authentication and task management sections of the app.Use CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap to style your components and make them visually appealing.
# 6.Error Handling:
Implement error handling for scenarios like incorrect login credentials, registration errors, or failed task updates.Display user-friendly error messages to guide users when something goes wrong.
# 7.Security Considerations:
Ensure that tasks are associated with the user who created them by using unique identifiers for each user.Implement proper data validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.Protect user data in local storage by encrypting sensitive information like passwords.
